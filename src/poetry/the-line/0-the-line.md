And she cuts the line with a card. A card, a symbol of a past life. She stares him in the face.

To think she used to be like him.
If those around him could see her now.
They would be delighted.
They would be distraught.
They would be disgusted.

Gods
Would he ever forgive her?
Will she ever forgive him?
For what he’s done? What he was? What he was to her? To them?

At least she can feel now
Her environment reacts
Her environment grows
around and with her

She can feel the constraints
She hides the scars that came from
twisting and turning and scraping her
hands and knees to fit
the role he was given to be
to be molded as they see fit

——

At least if this goes up their nose

They won’t be compelled to look
Down on them for who they are

And they won’t have to smell
The mold and fruitflies
The washing up

If she won’t get a second to breathe
She’ll clog up her nostrils
And gurgle her mouth
If she won’t get a second too
She’ll take her chances
