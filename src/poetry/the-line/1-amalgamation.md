You’re an amalgamation
Of antidepressants you swallow a few hours too late
With a room temperature glass of off-brand detriments to your health
That you couldn’t be bothered to wash
The alcohol out
From the night before

You’re an amalgamation
Of laundry baskets and sky high dishes
Passive aggressive remarks
You pretend don’t hurt your feelings

You’re an amalgamation
Of obsessing over an attempted moderation
Of obsessing over and attempted moderation
With money, drugs and people
So you check your bank account
And offload the sticker backings onto the table
But,
Not that spot
Thats where your old student card
With an incorrect name and incorrect face
Decorates a line that would’ve gone up your nose
Decorates a line that could’ve gone up your nose

Decorates a line that-

But it didn’t by hair
And a hair is a landslide for you
Dealing with issues in black and white
Lifting all the colour from your view
Until you can no longer know if what you do is right

So the clock ticks up as your shift ticks down
Wishing the limited human existence of yours would be sped up
For the sake of killing your work day
Hopefully without killing your work
At this point you detest,
who could blame you
But what’s the alternative?
Cutting your hair and going back
And pretend to be a-
Or begging for money

As a party goes on
You can’t bring yourself to go
Gods help me if they see my face
Or hear my voice
All desynced, delayed, distorted
Did they notice the makeup
Simply covering up
A skin-deep truth
Of this morphia, phoria

As people talk
You can’t bring yourself to talk
They’re not there for you,
You’re not there at all
As people talk
You can’t shake it off your shoulders
