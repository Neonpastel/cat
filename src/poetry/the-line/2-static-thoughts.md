Any thoughts turned to words
And all words turned to static
And static to vomit
And I can’t hold it
Any more
And break
And yet I’m static here
And feel justified in place
And a mirror I can’t face
Any actions I’d undertake
And undermine
And why won’t you
Show sobered up all at my door
Show that I am solely yours
Ignoring your own happiness
Show you that I care so much
Show it as your thoughts are mushed
